## Abstract

Generally you enjoy the work that you are doing on a day-by-day basis. You voluntarily and deliberately chose your field of work and you have no intention of quitting it. Improving your methods, strengthening your skills and deepening your knowledge (hence becoming a better worker) is something you are honestly looking forward to. You consider yourself lucky because of this.

Then again you hate work. You hate the overidentification with the products of work, whose value (hence yourself's own value) is measured rather by public peer affirmation than by real-world contribution. You hate the winner-takes-it-all mentality, which is embedded in our cultural definition of personal success. You hate the celebration of competitive performative workaholism. You just hate the pressure that comes with all that.

“No pressure, no diamonds!”, they says. We would need a work culture which stimulates adversity and distress. Only the pressure pushes you to excel, to go further and beyond, to create the extreme, the outstanding, the valuable.

Pressure boosting stimuli are not in short supply. So while increasing the pressure on yourself is fairly easy, reducing it – once you immersed yourself into the given work culture – can be a bit of a hassle.

Once you internalized the capitalist notion of the productivity-success-happiness relationship and potential limitless personal growth, aren't you heading straight into misery, depression and burn-out? How do you stay sane assuming that all that limits you is your personal ambition? How do you stop the question “Am I doing enough?” from constantly haunting you and draining the joy out of work?

There is an urge and obligation to take every of the seemingly endless opportunities, that offer themselves to you. The potential for personal advancement is always within reach, promising the ascent to the next step of the ladder. You can always work more, learn more, show more, post more, achieve more, be more active, be more invested, be more present, be more productive and aim higher. It is up to you but it is not optional. Because not doing so is sinning. Because a moment of lazyness, a missed chance, an unused opportunity means failing at self-actualization, not tapping your full personal potential and living a life of inferior quality.

How do you reject the notion that total exhaustion is the only valid reason to ever take a break? Is it possible to cultivate a habitat of personal sustainability, immunizing against the pressuring feeling of insufficiency and keeping the joy in work?

## Ideas

- conduct interviews about work culture with 3 known and experienced graphic designers (e.g. Eike König, Jakob Kirch, Sandra Döller), alternatively ask for essays and images

## Discarded Ideas

- ask former interns of famous graphic design studios to comment on their impression of the work culture (anonimously?)

## Notes

[Jennifer Szalai:	How the ‘Temp’ Economy Became the New Normal](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/books/review-temp-louis-hyman.html)

> “Temp” traces how, for corporations and government policymakers alike, “the risk-taking entrepreneur supplanted the risk-averse, but loyal, company man as the capitalist ideal.”

> As a former McKinsey consultant himself, Hyman likens associates to highly paid temps. They were indoctrinated to believe that “insecurity” was a goad for “excellence.” “A brutal lifestyle became a filter for becoming a successful consultant,” he writes, recalling colleagues who sacrificed their marriages and family lives in the process. “The people who reorganized corporations, by this filter, had little respect for stability.”

[Nastia Voynovskaya: Why Do Employers Lowball Creatives? A New Study Has Answers](https://www.kqed.org/arts/13857471/artist-passion-exploitation-duke-study)

> young professionals refer to low-paying gigs as "passion wages."

> "And for workers on the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum to organize, to form unions, to form worker associations in which collective norms like working less for higher pay becomes the goal, the aim, the normal state of affairs."

[Aggie Toppins: Designers, Please Pay Your Interns](https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/designers-please-pay-your-interns/)

[Silvio Lorusso: What Design Can’t Do — Graphic Design between Automation, Relativism, Élite and Cognitariat](https://networkcultures.org/entreprecariat/what-design-cant-do/)

> "The thing that pisses me off the most is the degradation of the intellectual role of the designer."

> Why waste time on design decisions when one can celebrate the aprioristic purity of the template?

> Perhaps partly because of this visual relativism and the democratization of tools, graphic design, at least the one produced in some avantgarde schools, underwent a process of intellectualization. A term that indicates the tendency to make writing and research the pivot of a designer’s practice. […] In this case, the intellectual role of the designer is only recognized by other designers.

> Graphic design becomes micromanagement, while the designer turns into a Kafkaesque, voice-controlled mouse.

> design is not a job but a lifestyle

> "sleep is overrated."

> And the aspiring designer, whether critical or not, doesn’t seem so different from the startupper working uninterruptedly in his basement in order to create a revolutionary product.

> But if it’s true that, as Tony Fry argues, design “either serves or subverts the status quo”, it is legitimate to ask whether within certain instances of design education, the impetus to subvert the status quo is precisely what ultimately serves it.

> […] the cognitive dissonance of what I call entreprecariat, the mutual influence between an entrepreneurial pressure, that happens especially at a social level, and an increasing form of perceived precarity, which is at the same time material, professional, and existential.

> “neoliberal perfectionism”

> Neoliberal ideology reveres competition, discourages cooperation, promotes ambition, and tethers personal worth to professional achievement. Unsurprisingly, societies governed by these values make people very judgmental, and very anxious about being judged.

> Neoliberal meritocracy […] has created a cutthroat environment in which every person is their own brand ambassador, the sole spokesman for their product (themselves) and broker of their own labor, in an endless sea of competition.

- [Francisco Laranjo: Automated Graphic Design](http://modesofcriticism.org/automated-graphic-design/)

> Software had effectively flattened tools, process and output into an inevitable standardisation.

> As a result, two types of design schools survived. One, a centralised, manual, nostalgic, craft school. The second, a cooperative of small, nomadic design schools built around systems thinking and political activism.

[Does Creativity Have to Come from Suffering?](https://onbeing.org/blog/does-creativity-have-to-come-from-suffering/)

> “In the West many people believe that creativity comes from torment, while in the East there is more of a tradition of great art coming from balance and realization.”

> I’ve seen well-known painters sit in intensive meditation retreats, all the while being quite torn about being there because they feared the end result would be losing their edge. I’ve seen writers equate balance with dullness, and peace with torpor. I’ve known actors and musicians who feared contentment because that seemed to them the last step before being asleep.

[The Human Side of Teamwork](https://toggl.com/timesheets-magazine-berlin/6th-finger-human-side-teamwork/)

> I was thinking and reading a lot about collectivism vs. individualism recently and I’ve started connecting these ideas with the feeling of overworking. We are all immersed in this individualistic idea of ‘I made it,’ it's ‘my idea,’ ‘my project,’ ‘my company,’ and I think this is what creates our feelings of missing out and losing time.

[General Performance](https://www.e-flux.com/journal/31/68212/general-performance/)

> When labor becomes general performance, time-as-measure erodes; “flexible working hours” means that all hours are potentially working hours, and every encounter potentially becomes a form of networking and hence self-performance.

> The new labor is marked by the inability to distinguish between labor and leisure, between work and occupation, between working hours and free time—between performance and life.
