> "The thing that pisses me off the most is the degradation of the intellectual role of the designer."
> Why waste time on design decisions when one can celebrate the aprioristic purity of the template?
> Perhaps partly because of this visual relativism and the democratization of tools, graphic design, at least the one produced in some avantgarde schools, underwent a process of intellectualization. A term that indicates the tendency to make writing and research the pivot of a designer’s practice. […] In this case, the intellectual role of the designer is only recognized by other designers.
> Graphic design becomes micromanagement, while the designer turns into a Kafkaesque, voice-controlled mouse.
> design is not a job but a lifestyle
