Wartung ist für Ukeles das Gebiet der menschlicher Aktivitäten, die Dinge in Gang zu halten, wie Kochen, Putzen und Kindererziehung. Zu ihren Auftritten in den 1970er Jahren gehörte die Reinigung von Kunstgalerien.“

## Notes

[Nastia Voynovskaya: Why Do Employers Lowball Creatives? A New Study Has Answers](https://www.kqed.org/arts/13857471/artist-passion-exploitation-duke-study)

> young professionals refer to low-paying gigs as "passion wages."

> "And for workers on the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum to organize, to form unions, to form worker associations in which collective norms like working less for higher pay becomes the goal, the aim, the normal state of affairs."

[Aggie Toppins: Designers, Please Pay Your Interns](https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/designers-please-pay-your-interns/)

> a love for design is reward enough for working

> the widespread expectation of unpaid labor in our field is a form of systematic exploitation

[Silvio Lorusso: What Design Can’t Do — Graphic Design between Automation, Relativism, Élite and Cognitariat](https://networkcultures.org/entreprecariat/what-design-cant-do/)

> "The thing that pisses me off the most is the degradation of the intellectual role of the designer."

> Why waste time on design decisions when one can celebrate the aprioristic purity of the template?

> Perhaps partly because of this visual relativism and the democratization of tools, graphic design, at least the one produced in some avantgarde schools, underwent a process of intellectualization. A term that indicates the tendency to make writing and research the pivot of a designer’s practice. […] In this case, the intellectual role of the designer is only recognized by other designers.

> Graphic design becomes micromanagement, while the designer turns into a Kafkaesque, voice-controlled mouse.

> design is not a job but a lifestyle

> "sleep is overrated."

> And the aspiring designer, whether critical or not, doesn’t seem so different from the startupper working uninterruptedly in his basement in order to create a revolutionary product.

> But if it’s true that, as Tony Fry argues, design “either serves or subverts the status quo”, it is legitimate to ask whether within certain instances of design education, the impetus to subvert the status quo is precisely what ultimately serves it.

> […] the cognitive dissonance of what I call entreprecariat, the mutual influence between an entrepreneurial pressure, that happens especially at a social level, and an increasing form of perceived precarity, which is at the same time material, professional, and existential.

> the notion of individual genius

- [Meagan Day: Under Neoliberalism, You Can Be Your Own Tyrannical Boss](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/01/under-neoliberalism-you-can-be-your-own-tyrannical-boss)

> “neoliberal perfectionism”

> Neoliberal ideology reveres competition, discourages cooperation, promotes ambition, and tethers personal worth to professional achievement. Unsurprisingly, societies governed by these values make people very judgmental, and very anxious about being judged.

> Neoliberal meritocracy […] has created a cutthroat environment in which every person is their own brand ambassador, the sole spokesman for their product (themselves) and broker of their own labor, in an endless sea of competition.

- [Francisco Laranjo: Automated Graphic Design](http://modesofcriticism.org/automated-graphic-design/)

> Software had effectively flattened tools, process and output into an inevitable standardisation.

> As a result, two types of design schools survived. One, a centralised, manual, nostalgic, craft school. The second, a cooperative of small, nomadic design schools built around systems thinking and political activism.

- [Timo Hinze: Die flüssige Fabrik](http://spectorbooks.com/de/die-fluessige-fabrik)

> Wandel des Arbeitsprinzips in den 60ern

> Was sagen Künstler über Arbeit? (z.B. Situationisten)

> Maschinenstürmerin zerstört zuerst die Werksuhr

> Adobe, WeWork, Arbeitsverbände

> Wäre ein Blick auf Arbeitsplätze interessant? Z.B. auf die berühmter (historischer) Designer\*innen?

> Über Arbeit reden mit arbeitenden Künstlern, Designern, Kulturschaffenden: David Voss, Eike König, Timo Hinze, Sandra Döller, Neurotic Asshole, Laury Penny

> Nicht die Leidenschaft, Sinnsuche und Projektionen (S. 79) des Arbeiters sind das Problem, sondern deren Ausbeutung (kontextualisieren, nicht pathologisieren)

> Suche nach Identität, Verwirklichung, biografischem Reichtum, Unsterblichkeit, Sinn, Bedeutung, Karriere, Wachstum

> Setting: Selbstausbeutung = Erfüllung

> Insuffizienzgefühl -> Depression

> Prinzip Fabrik -> Prinzip Unternehmen -> Prinzip Gig-Economy (Hollow Man, S. 9, Kommissar, S. 29)

- Eduardo Galeano, Das Recht zu Träumen (erschienen im Karuna Kompass)

> "Die Leute arbeiten, um zu leben, anstatt zu leben, um zu arbeiten."


[FLIPPING WORK](https://www.spikeartmagazine.com/articles/flipping-work
https://www.spikeartmagazine.com/articles/flipping-work)

> passionate self-exploitation at the entry level of culture work

[Working Smart](http://www.ripostemagazine.com/working-smart)

> However, if you over-stretch yourself, fatigue starts to kick in, your decision-making can be more emotive, you get sick and getting “into the flow” is a lot trickier. The trick is to recognise the signs of when you’re over-pushing yourself and to take a break. You may be working six days a week, but in reality you might only be productive for four!

[Manga on overwork hell goes viral in wake of Dentsu suicide reports](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/10/28/national/social-issues/manga-overwork-hell-goes-viral-wake-dentsu-suicide-reports/)

> At the time, Shiomachi was a graphic designer at a small advertising company making flyers and posters. Although she enjoyed her job, the workload was tough. Clients sometimes demanded her attention at 3 a.m. or wanted a job completed within six hours.

[The Tragic Art of Overworking](https://medium.com/@kstedman_87719/the-tragic-art-of-overworking-50e431047c24)

> Fiverrs "In Doers We Trust" Campaign Critique

> these individual occurrences make up what has become known as the “tragic” or “tortured” artist — the idea that creatives must inherently be brooding, miserable, lonely souls.

> businessmen are just as familiar with declining mental health and suicide as we perceive artists to be

> artist stereotypes: lonely

[Does Creativity Have to Come from Suffering?](https://onbeing.org/blog/does-creativity-have-to-come-from-suffering/)

> “In the West many people believe that creativity comes from torment, while in the East there is more of a tradition of great art coming from balance and realization.”

> I’ve seen well-known painters sit in intensive meditation retreats, all the while being quite torn about being there because they feared the end result would be losing their edge. I’ve seen writers equate balance with dullness, and peace with torpor. I’ve known actors and musicians who feared contentment because that seemed to them the last step before being asleep.

> good poetry must come from sadness

[The myth of tormented genius: the link between mental health and creativity](https://studentnewspaper.org/the-myth-of-tormented-genius-the-link-between-mental-health-and-creativity/)

> he long 18th century of Romanticism, and the idolisation of a secluded, emotional genius

> the torment that is inseparable from a great talent.

> We live in a society that prioritises productivity above all; where the signs of mental health problems that can lead to disability become somewhat justified, or even normalised if creative value is produced.

[What Does It Mean to Unionize When You’re Your Own Boss?](https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/what-does-it-mean-to-unionize-when-youre-your-own-boss/)

> “Designers also feel very grateful to be within the so called creative class, which can easily lead to people being taken advantage of,”

[The Human Side of Teamwork](https://toggl.com/timesheets-magazine-berlin/6th-finger-human-side-teamwork/)

> I was thinking and reading a lot about collectivism vs. individualism recently and I’ve started connecting these ideas with the feeling of overworking. We are all immersed in this individualistic idea of ‘I made it,’ it's ‘my idea,’ ‘my project,’ ‘my company,’ and I think this is what creates our feelings of missing out and losing time.

[General Performance](https://www.e-flux.com/journal/31/68212/general-performance/)

> When labor becomes general performance, time-as-measure erodes; “flexible working hours” means that all hours are potentially working hours, and every encounter potentially becomes a form of networking and hence self-performance.

>  widen the gap between successful “high performers” and the rest

> The new labor is marked by the inability to distinguish between labor and leisure, between work and occupation, between working hours and free time—between performance and life.

- Abstract (Netflix Series)

> Olafur Eliasson: "Gute Ideen kommen mir, wenn ich hart arbeite."
